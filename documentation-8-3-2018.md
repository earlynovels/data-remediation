# END Data Remediation Summer 2018

Sam Herron; completed 8-3-18
 
## Dataset modifications: to 0913
- All records with no date given filler date 10/10/10 (END only began to record dates in 2011, and so these records are generally the early ones, barring those later records that for some reason are dateless.) 6/18/2018
- Added 260$c to records 440217, 440221, 440259 (identified by Alice as being without a publication date.) 6/20/2018
- Other records provided by Alice have weirder issues: 380966 has different date in 260 vs. 001. 440313 and 440377 are both missing entire 260 field. 440425 is just a bizarre record, very sparse?
