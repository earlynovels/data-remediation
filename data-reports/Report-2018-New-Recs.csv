II lightly discoloured by damp, some other stains and general signs of use, corners torn from a couple of leaves (not affecting text), contempary calf, neatly rebacked. One of the two Irish editions to appear in 1796; originally published in four volumes at the Minerva Press in the previous year. Walker was a London bookseller and author of ten or eleven novels, the best known ofwhich is the vagabond, a very clever and high.y amusing burlesque on the ""new philosophy"" of William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft et al. As a distributor of all sorts of fiction, Walker was able to adjust the types of novel he wrote according to contemporary literary demands. Aside from Gothic fiction, novels of radical ideas and the tractarian fiction of the so-called polemical school of Godwin, Bage and Holcroftwere in high demand: ""Social horrors and the terrifying climate ot adversary politicalideas were frequently presented to readers by way of Gothic paraphernalia and symbols in these novels. Walker's contribution to the Gothic novel of ideas, TheHouse of Tynian, mixes humanitarian sentiment, Gothic intrigue, and rationalist polemics to expose the weaknesses in Godwin's anarchic theories. it is a novel of both forbidden chambers and forbidden social ideas... Much traditional Gothic activity does on within the House... but Walker was intent on getting beyond the usual Gothic gadgetry or to use the gadgetry to make a point. He hoped to instruct and reform the reader with respect to the dangerous wrongness of the cult of ego which he found in Godwin's theories of individual freedon."" -Frank. Cf. Block, p. 247; Raven and Forster 1795:46; Frank, The first Gothics 462.
